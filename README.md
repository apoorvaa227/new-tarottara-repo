Classifies natural language into categories like:

yes_no, timeline, guidance, general, factual

🔮 Tarot Reading Engine (tarot/tarot_reader.py)
Draws cards (1 for timeline, 3 for general)

Uses LangChain + LLaMA to interpret cards

Adds context from PDF-based RAG if needed

📘 Knowledge Base RAG (rag/rag.py)
Processes PDFs (1.pdf, 2.pdf)

Uses sentence embeddings + ChromaDB for similarity search

🗣️ Voice Interaction (voice/)
input.py: record from mic or transcribe uploaded audio

output.py: synthesize voice from text, replay on demand

🧾 User Logging (user_info/)
Captures user session info

Stores as PDF using fpdf
